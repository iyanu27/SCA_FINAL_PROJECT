# SCA_FINAL_PROJECT

# Deploying a 3 tier application frontend, API, database to Kubernetes cluster  using GCP

I was able  to publish a simple yet functional setup for a dockerized app with Laravel backend and Vue.JS frontend.

## Introduction

To containerize an application refers to the process of adapting an application and its components in order to be able to run it in lightweight environments known as containers.

In this project, i used docker Compose and dockerfile to containerize a Laravel application and vuejs for development.
